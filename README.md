**EXstat** is a R package which provide an efficient and simple solution to aggregate and analyze the stationarity of time series.

EXstat is highly customizable, but the **CARD** extension provides a simpler solution for performing common hydroclimatic aggregations. See the  [CARD documentation]() of the [CARD package](https://github.com/louis-heraut/CARD) for advance understanding.

This project was carried out for National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (Institut National de Recherche pour l‚ÄôAgriculture, l‚ÄôAlimentation et l‚ÄôEnvironnement, [INRAE](https://agriculture.gouv.fr/inrae-linstitut-national-de-recherche-pour-lagriculture-lalimentation-et-lenvironnement) in french) and is at the core of [MAKAHO](https://github.com/louis-heraut/MAKAHO) which won the [2024 Open Science Research Data Award](https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/fr/remise-des-prix-science-ouverte-des-donnees-de-la-recherche-2024-98045) in the ‚ÄúCreating the Conditions for Reuse‚Äù category.


## Installation
For latest development version

## Documentation
### Extraction process
Based on [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), **input data** format is a `tibble` of at least a column of **date**, some columns of **numeric value** and one or more **character** columns for names of time series in order to identify them uniquely. Thus it is possible to have a `tibble` with multiple time series which can be grouped by their names.

For example, we can use the following `tibble` : 

``` R
library(dplyr)

# Date
Start = as.Date("1972-01-01")
End = as.Date("2020-12-31")
Date = seq.Date(Start, End, by="day")

# Value to analyse
set.seed(100)
X = seq(1, length(Date))/1e4 + runif(length(Date), -100, 100)
X[as.Date("2000-03-01") <= Date & Date <= as.Date("2000-09-30")] = NA

# Creation of tibble
data = tibble(Date=Date, ID="serie A", X=X)
```

Which looks like that :
``` R
> data
# A tibble: 17,898 √ó 3
   Date       ID           X
   <date>     <chr>    <dbl>
 1 1972-01-01 serie A -38.4 
 2 1972-01-02 serie A -48.5 
 3 1972-01-03 serie A  10.5 
 4 1972-01-04 serie A -88.7 
 5 1972-01-05 serie A  -6.29
 6 1972-01-06 serie A  -3.25
 7 1972-01-07 serie A  62.5 
 8 1972-01-08 serie A -25.9 
 9 1972-01-09 serie A   9.31
10 1972-01-10 serie A -65.9 
# ‚Ñπ 17,888 more rows
# ‚Ñπ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

The process of **variable extraction** (for example the yearly mean of time series) is realised with the `process_extraction()` function.
Minimum arguments are :
* Input `data` described above
* The function `funct` (for example `mean`) you want to use. Arguments of the chosen function can be passed to this extraction process and the function can be previously defined.

Some of the optional arguments are :
* `period` A vector of two dates (or two unambiguous character strings that can be coerced to dates) to restrict the period of analysis. As an example, it can be `c("1950-01-01", "2020-12-31")` to select data from the 1st January of 1950 to the end of December of 2020. The default option is `period=NULL`, which considers all available data for each time serie.
* `time_step` A character string specifying the time step of the variable extraction process. Possible values are :
  - "year" for a value per year
  - "month" for a value for each month of the year (so 12 values if at least a full year is given)
  - "year-month" for a value for each month of each year (so 12 times the number of given year values at the end)
  - "season" for a value for each season of th year (so by default 4 values)
  - "year-season" for a value for each season of each year (so by default 4 times the number of given year values at the end)
  - "yearday" for one value per day of the year (so 365 values at the end if at least a full year is given... but more than one year seems obviously more interesting)
  - "none" if you want to extract a unique value for the whole time serie
* `sampling_period` A character string or a vector of two character strings that will indicate how to sample the data for each time step defined by `time_step`. Hence, the choice of this argument needs to be link with the choice of the time step. For example, for a yearly extraction so if `time_step` is set to `"year"`, `sampling_period` needs to be formated as `%m-%d` (a month - a day of the year) in order to indicate the start of the sampling of data for the current year. More precisly, if `time_step="year"` and `sampling_period="03-19"`, `funct` will be apply on every data from the 3rd march of each year to the 2nd march of the following one. In this way, it is possible to create a sub-year sampling with a vector of two character strings as `sampling_period=c("02-01", "07-31")` in order to process data only if the date is between the 1st february and the 31th jully of each year.

More parameters are available, for example, to :
* handle missing values,
* use suffixes to simplify expressions, and
* manage variables related to seasonality.

In this way
``` R
dataEX = process_extraction(data=data,
                            funct=max,
                            funct_args=list("X", na.rm=TRUE),
                            time_step="year",
                            sampling_period=c("05-01",
                                              "11-30"),
                            period=c(as.Date("1990-01-01"),
                                     as.Date("2020-12-31")))
```

will perform a yearly extraction of the maximum value between may and november, from the 1th march of 1990 to the 31th october of 2020, ignoring `NA` values.

The output is also a `tibble` with a column of **date**, of **character** for the name of time series and a **numerical** column with the extracted variable from the time series.

``` R
> dataEX
# A tibble: 31 √ó 3
   ID      Date           X
   <chr>   <date>     <dbl>
 1 serie A 1990-05-01 100. 
 2 serie A 1991-05-01 101. 
 3 serie A 1992-05-01 100. 
 4 serie A 1993-05-01  99.9
 5 serie A 1994-05-01  99.0
 6 serie A 1995-05-01 100. 
 7 serie A 1996-05-01 100. 
 8 serie A 1997-05-01 101. 
 9 serie A 1998-05-01  99.6
10 serie A 1999-05-01 101. 
# ‚Ñπ 21 more rows
# ‚Ñπ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

Other examples of more complex cases are available in the package documentation. Try starting with 
``` R
library(EXstat)
?EXstat
```


### Trend analyse
The stationarity analyse is computed with the `process_trend()` function on the extracted data `dataEX`. The **statistical test** used here is the **Mann-Kendall test**[^mann][^kendall].

Hence, the following expression

``` R
trendEX = process_trend(data=dataEX)
```

produces the result below

```
# A tibble: 1 √ó 12
  ID      variable_en level H          p      a     b period_trend
  <chr>   <chr>       <dbl> <lgl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <list>      
1 serie A X             0.1 TRUE  0.0958 0.0260  99.3 <date [2]>

  mean_period_trend a_normalise a_normalise_min a_normalise_max
  <lgl>                   <dbl>           <dbl>           <dbl>
1 NA                     0.0260          0.0260          0.0260
```

It is a `tibble` which precises, among other information, the name of the time serie the **p value** and `a` the **Theil-Sen's slope**[^theil][^sen], for each row.

Finaly, as the **p value** is below 0.1, the previous time serie shows an **increasing linear trend** which can be represented by the equation `Y = 0.0260*X + b` with a **type I error** of 10 % or a **trust** of 90 %.
